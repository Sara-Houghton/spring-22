If you or your kid are learning gymnastics for the first time, you may be finding that beginner gymnastics skills can be challenging without a baseline of flexibility. Your kid may be doing a stretching routine in class, but this will only be so effective when done once a week. Stretching at home will improve the flexibility needed to practice skills in class. 

Gymnasts can follow a similar flexibility routine to their routine in practice. There are a few gymnastics stretches used in any gym, and they donâ€™t require any equipment. These stretches are generally the straddle, pike, splits, and backbend.
