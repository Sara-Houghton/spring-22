Your kid may have been invited to a gymnastics team tryout, or you may be interested in asking your gym about competitive options. You may have heard phrases thrown around like J.O. and Xcel, or you may be concerned about the demanding time commitment you’ve heard about.

This article will address all these topics and more regarding the common question, “is competitive gymnastics worth it?”

When discussing competitive gymnastics, it’s important to start with explaining the two very different programs: Xcel and J.O. Each program features gymnasts of different ages, different skill levels, different time commitments, different costs and ultimately different purposes.


``` js/2/4
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;

	counter++;

}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```
